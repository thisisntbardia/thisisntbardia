I'm a Software Engineer with 2 years of backend development experience, focused on building scalable, high-performance systems. I work with C++, C, Python, and technologies like FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MQTT to deliver reliable solutions with 99.5% uptime.

With a BSc in Software Engineering from Islamic Azad University, I’ve designed microservices, optimized databases, led real-time IoT projects for 10,000+ devices, and streamlined CI/CD pipelines. I write clean, testable code and thrive in Linux environments.

Fluent in English and conversational in French, I’m driven, adaptable, and always looking for environments where I can learn, grow, and make an impact.
