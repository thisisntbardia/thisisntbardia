I’m a backend-focused Software Engineer who likes building systems that stay fast and stable as they scale. Most of my work is in Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django), often in microservice environments, with a lot of attention on performance and reliability.

I work hands-on with PostgreSQL and Oracle (PL/pgSQL / PL/SQL), and I use Redis and MongoDB when caching or high-volume data handling is needed. I also set up the delivery pipeline: Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI), and Nginx on Debian/Ubuntu.

When the project needs it, I ship end-to-end features too — including Flutter apps.
